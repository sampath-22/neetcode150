#Longest Consecutive Sequence

#Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.

#A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.
